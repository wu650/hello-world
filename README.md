Sample repository to test features

Hi, I'm wu650,

I am currently in the midst of a career transition into software engineering!
I've been working through cs50 and have decided to utilize GitHub to track
versions for my final project. I have decent experience programming in C, and
basic familiarity with Python. Currently I am working to expand my knowledge 
of Java!
